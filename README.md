# Camp Connect

The frontend web portal for Camp Connect, a virtual summer camp for middle schoolers
that serves as an alternative to in-person camps affected by the COVID-19 crisis.
This web portal is written in React + Typescript, with Redux.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository with the following command in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/schen9981/camp-connect.git
```

Once this has been cloned, run
```
cd camp-connect/camp-connect
```
to access the react application. Then, you'll want to install appropriate dependencies
using
```
npm install
```
Now, you have everything setup to begin development! To see your application
on your local computer at localhost:3000, run either
```
yarn start
``` 
or
```
npm start
```
VS Code and Atom both have good text recognition for React/Typescript so feel free to use either (but VS Code has good autocompleting which you might find helpful). If you're using VS Code, I'd recommend installing the Prettier extension to auto format your code when you save.

More info about the contents of the react app are in the documentation.txt files in
the subdirectories of src.
