This directory contains all components that can reused in other
pages/parts of the website. For each component you decide to create,
create a directory named the component, and create the .tsx and .css file
inside it.

For instance, if you want to create a Navbar component, create a directory
called Navbar. Then, inside the directory, create a Navbar.tsx and
Navbar.css file.

Once you've done this, document this component here!
